            <p class="info">Mother Teresa (August 26, 1910–September 5, 1997) was a Roman Catholic nun who devoted her life to serving the poor and destitute around the world. She spent many years in Calcutta, India where she founded the Missionaries of Charity, a religious congregation devoted to helping those in great need.
                She founded the Missionaries of Charity, a Catholic order of nuns dedicated to helping the poor. Begun in Calcutta, India, the Missionaries of Charity grew to help the poor, dying, orphans, lepers, and AIDS sufferers in more than 100 countries. Mother Teresa's selfless effort to help those in need has 
                caused many to regard her as a model humanitarian.
                In 1979, Mother Teresa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and became a symbol of charitable, selfless work.
                In 2016, Mother Teresa was canonised by the Roman Catholic Church as Saint Teresa.</p>
